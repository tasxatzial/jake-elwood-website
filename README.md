# Jake & Elwood website

A simple website for a fictional company that provides SEO services.

This project is part of the responsive design course from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). [Design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/f255d364-6d5e-4aaf-7703-6f8d0a398281-8464/) and starter files are provided by [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell/reponsive-web-design-bootcamp/).
